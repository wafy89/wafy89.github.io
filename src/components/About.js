                going outside if the weather is nice.

                During the web-development course I was the class tutor, helping my
                classmates to understand our subjects. This also helped me to
                improve my understanding, since explaining our exercises and
                lessons to my classmates has also improved my experience.

                at Syrian-Virtual-University. this program was business focused
                but it also contained web-development at the basic level. I
                liked this field but I did't get the chance to work since this
                field was very new in syria and no chances were available. but
                when I came to germany I looked for such courses and luckily I
                found a good One and I was all the Time interested of its
                content.
